                                        pretty slow. Actually, this disadvantage is not too \
                                        severe since all Phoenix type helicopters are equipped \
                                        with a $mark(teleporting device), which can beam the \
                                        helicopter to another location and make it \
                                        indestructible for a brief moment. Only Phoenix type \
                                        helicopters can purchase the $mark(\
                                        special upgrade) \
                                        $mark(\"Short-range radiation\"). With this upgrade, the \
                                        plating of all opponents in close distance will be \
                                        considerably weakened, causing them to take severe \
                                        damage when colliding with the helicopter. On the \
                                        other hand, the helicopter will take less damage when \
                                        colliding with irradiated flying vessels. \
                                        $mark(Standard \
                                        upgrades) of the helicopter's \
                                        $mark(firepower) will also \
                                        improve the intensity of short-range radiation. When a \
                                        helicopter teleports itself to another location and \
                                        there instantly destroys multiple enemies, the player \
                                        will be rewarded with $mark(bonus \
                                        credit). Another way to \
                                        receive a bonus credit is to eliminate a hostile flying \
                                        vessel by missile attack immediately after using the \
                                        teleporting device.

                                        Additionally, only Roch type helicopters can acquire \
                                        the special upgrade $mark(\"Jumbo \
                                        missiles\"), which gives \
                                        their missiles enormous explosive force. Because of \
                                        this, no other helicopter class can reach comparable \
                                        high firepower. However, Roch type helicopters only \
                                        have pretty low $mark(fire rate) and also their \
                                        $mark(plating) is \
                                        inferior. However, an $mark(energy \
                                        shield) compensates for \
                                        their weak plating. If the pilot of a Roch type \
                                        helicopter manages to destroy multiple flying vessels \
                                        with the same missile, he will be rewarded with \

                                        high fire rate. Combined with \
                                        $mark(plasma missiles), which \
                                        have much more explosive force, this helicopter type \
                                        can achieve considerable high damage output per second. \
                                        However, the activation of plasma missiles consumes \
                                        energy and only lasts for 15 seconds. Therefore, plasma \
                                        missiles can not be used permanently and the timing of \
                                        their activation must be considered carefully. If the \
                                        pilot of a Kamaitachi type helicopter manages to \

                                        $mark(Pegasus type helicopters) would be at a serious \
                                        disadvantage if they had to rely on their missiles \
                                        alone. However, these helicopters are equipped with a \
                                        powerful $mark(EMP generator) which emits electromagnetic \
                                        pulses that damage and stun all hostile flying vessels \
                                        in a certain area around the helicopter. Upgrades of \
                                        the EMP generator increase the damage output as well \
                                        as the EMP's area of effect. The destruction of \
                                        multiple enemies with the same electromagnetic pulse \
                                        is rewarded with $mark(bonus credit). Another important \
                                        feature of Pegasus type helicopters is their \
                                        $mark(interphase \
                                        generator). It allows the \
                                        helicopter to partially shift \
                                        into another dimension. In this state, the helicopter \
                                        is protected against any kind of damage. If no missile \
                                        was launched and no EMP was released for a certain \
                                        time, the interphase generator is activated \
                                        automatically. Upgrading $mark(fire \
                                        rate) also shortens \
                                        the time required for phase shifting. Missiles that \
                                        are launched during a phase shift, are in an \
                                        intermediate state between two dimensions and can \
                                        therefore easily penetrate the enemy's plating \
                                        resulting in severe damage. After launching a missile, \
                                        the helicopter shifts back into its original state.
