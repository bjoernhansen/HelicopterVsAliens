                                        vessels of unknown origin have been spotted on the \
                                        northern Sahara and along the African Mediterranean \
                                        coast. Some of these flying vessels already started \
                                        attacking the North African megacities including the \
                                        world's capital Cairo. Karanijem Su, president of the \

                                        and is now asking reservists and volunteers from all \
                                        over the world for help. You are one of them.

                                        can achieve considerable high damage output per second. \
                                        However, the activation of plasma missiles consumes \
                                        energy and only lasts for 15 seconds. Therefore, plasma \
                                        missiles can not be used permanently and the timing of \
                                        their activation must be considered carefully. If the \
                                        pilot of a Kamaitachi type helicopter manages to \
                                        destroy \
                                        multiple enemies within a very short period of time, he \
                                        will be rewarded for his brave actions with generous \

                                        <font color=\"#D2D2D2\"> would be at a serious \
                                        disadvantage if they had to rely on their missiles \
                                        alone. However, these helicopters are equipped with a \
                                        powerful <font color=\"#FFFFD2\">EMP generator\
                                        <font color=\"#D2D2D2\"> which emits electromagnetic \
                                        pulses that damage and stun all hostile flying vessels \
                                        in a certain area around the helicopter. Upgrades of \
                                        the EMP generator increase the damage output as well \
                                        as the EMP's area of effect. The destruction of \
                                        multiple enemies with the same electromagnetic pulse \
                                        is rewarded with <font color=\"#FFFFD2\">bonus credit\
                                        <font color=\"#D2D2D2\">. Another important \
                                        feature of Pegasus type helicopters is their \
                                        <font color=\"#FFFFD2\">interphase \
                                        generator<font color=\"#D2D2D2\">. It allows the \
                                        helicopter to partially shift \
                                        into another dimension. In this state, the helicopter \
                                        is protected against any kind of damage. If no missile \
                                        was launched and no EMP was released for a certain \
                                        time, the interphase generator is activated \
                                        automatically. Upgrading <font color=\"#FFFFD2\">fire \
                                        rate<font color=\"#D2D2D2\"> also shortens \
                                        the time required for phase shifting. Missiles that \
                                        are launched during a phase shift, are in an \
                                        intermediate state between two dimensions and can \
                                        therefore easily penetrate the enemy's plating \
                                        resulting in severe damage. After launching a missile, \
                                        the helicopter shifts back into its original state.
